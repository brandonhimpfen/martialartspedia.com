## Snapshot {#snapshot}

This is a stable summary of what the art prioritizes and what the reader can expect to find documented.

## History and context {#history}

Separate documented history from common narratives. Record uncertainty when sources disagree.

## Training methods {#training}

Describe structure and pedagogy, not a how-to guide. The goal is preservation, not instruction.

## Rules and incentives {#rules}

Explain how rules shape what spreads, what is filmed, and what gets emphasized.

## Sources and media {#sources}
